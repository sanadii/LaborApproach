# LaborApproach: Getting Started Guide
LaborApproach is a real-time chat application that leverages Django and Channels for a seamless messaging experience. This guide will walk you through setting up a new Django project on a Windows environment, using Python 3.8.2, Django 2.2.15 (LTS), virtualenv, Redis, Django Channels 2, and Sqlite.

For a comprehensive guide on pushing a project like this to production, check out this repo: HOWTO-django-channels-daphne.

# Features
## Current Features
1. Real-Time Messaging: Users can send and receive messages instantly.
2. User Authentication: Secure login system to access the chat.
3. WebSocket Support: Utilizes WebSockets for real-time bidirectional communication.
4. Simple and Intuitive UI: Easy-to-use interface for a better user experience.

## Future Features
1. Group Chat Functionality: Ability to create and manage group chats.
2. Message Encryption: Implement end-to-end encryption for secure conversations.
3. Media Sharing: Capability to share images, videos, and files.
5. Notifications: Real-time notifications for new messages.
6. Customizable Themes: Personalize the chat interface with themes and colors.
7. Voice and Video Calls: Integrate voice and video calling features.

# Technologies Used
- Django: A high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
- Django Channels: Extends Django to handle WebSockets, chat protocols, IoT protocols, and more.
- Daphne: An HTTP, HTTP2, and WebSocket protocol server for ASGI and ASGI-HTTP, developed as part of the Django Channels project.
- Redis: Used as a channel layer for Django Channels.

# Prerequisites
1. Python 3.8.2
2. pip
3. Django 2.2.15 (LTS)
4. virtualenv
5. Redis
6. Django Channels 2
7. SQlite

# Installation Steps
## Install Python 3.8.2
Download and install from the Python website.

## Installing pip
Visit pip's official site.
Open cmd prompt and run pip install pip.

## Setup virtualenv
Navigate to your Django projects directory (e.g., D://DjangoProjects/).
Create a new folder for your project, e.g., D://

## DjangoProjects/LaborApproach.
Inside this folder, create a virtual environment: python -m venv venv.

## Activate the virtual environment:
Windows: Scripts\activate
Linux/Mac: source bin/activate
Install Django and Create Project
Install Django: python -m pip install Django==2.2.15.
Create the Django project: django-admin startproject LaborApproach.
Rename the root directory to src.
Track libraries: pip freeze > requirements.txt.
Test the server: python manage.py runserver and visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/.
Sqlite Setup (Windows)

## Download and install Sqlite.
Confirm the service is running in the "Services" window.
Access the database: psql Sqlite Sqlite.
Use SqliteQL commands to set up your database and user.
Django and Sqlite Setup

## Install psycopg2: pip install psycopg2.
Update requirements.txt: pip freeze > requirements.txt.
Configure settings.py with Sqlite details.
Delete the SQLite database and migrate: python manage.py migrate.
Create a superuser and log into the admin panel.

## Install Redis
Download and install Memurai.
Update settings.py with CHANNEL_LAYERS configuration.
Django Channels Setup
Install Channels: python -m pip install -U channels.
Add Channels to INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py.
Create a default routing file and set up ASGI in settings.py.

## Next Steps
After setting up your environment, you can start developing your LaborApproach application. Create your models, views, and templates, and begin integrating Channels for real-time communication. Remember to regularly commit your changes to a version control system like Git.

For detailed instructions on each step and more advanced configurations, refer to the respective official documentation of each technology used. Happy coding! ğŸš€
